## Introduction:
Ride-hailing has become an increasingly common mode of transportation in every urban city of the world. With the convenience of smartphones, 4G data, and secure payment systems â€“ ride-hailing turns out to be a natural and much needed facility defying all traditional transport mechanisms of the past.
